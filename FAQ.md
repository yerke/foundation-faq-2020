## Overview of the foundation

<a id="q-name"></a>
**ü§î Q: What's the name of the foundation?**

üíÅ A: The name of the foundation will be "Rust Foundation"!

<a id="q-why-independent"></a>
**ü§î Q: Why an independent foundation?**

üíÅ A: After spending a significant amount of time researching potential umbrella organizations, we decided that our best option was to incorporate an independent entity. Rust is a technology and community that is value driven and we simply didn‚Äôt find an organization that we felt was aligned with our community goals. This does mean more work for us, especially upfront, but we think the tradeoff is worth it.

## Purpose and scope

<a id="q-purpose"></a>
**ü§î Q: What is the purpose of the Rust foundation?**

üíÅ A: The Rust foundation‚Äôs purpose is to enable Rust maintainers to do their best work happily. The Rust core team believes that the best Rust will be made by happy maintainers, and focusing the Foundation‚Äôs efforts on maintainers will provide for a better Rust for all.

The Foundation‚Äôs structure includes active project members on the board who will guide the Foundation‚Äôs efforts to best serve the needs of the Rust project.

<a id="q-scope"></a>
**ü§î Q: What is the initial scope of the foundation?**

üíÅ A: The central goal of the Foundation is to enable Rust contributors, especially those that are volunteering and not supported by their employer. To that end, the Foundation will offer training, software, and structural support for contributors to the Rust project. Contributors are engaged in all kinds of activities, ranging from writing software code to moderating forums to translation, and each needs a distinct form of support. We expect that the Foundation will be able to start providing support for the activities within the first year. A few examples of ways the Foundation could support contributors:

* Access to a lawyer if a team needs legal advice, such as on how to handle DMCAs for the crates.io team, or resolving licensing questions from the compiler team
* Paying for tools and services a team needs, like a video calls platform for a team that wants to run sync meetings or a helpdesk tool for help@crates.io.
* Supporting efforts to grow and diversify Rust‚Äôs leadership, such as Increasing Rust‚Äôs Reach
* Running the annual survey to provide insights to the teams on what the wider community wants to see from the project.

To be clear, those are just examples that the future board of directors will need to decide whether to approve or not, and it‚Äôs definitely not an exhaustive list. The role of the foundation is to serve the project, not the other way around: Rust contributors should see the Rust Foundation as a helpful resource to empower their work. If a team needs something they‚Äôll be encouraged to reach out to the foundation to solve their needs.

In terms of assets, the Foundation will own and steward the trademarks. It will also own crates.io and the project‚Äôs infrastructure, but the operations and decision-making for those will continue to be in the hands of the current teams.

<a id="q-hiring"></a>
**ü§î Q: Will the foundation hire every Rust contributor?**

üíÅ A: No, but it will hire for a few specialized roles, such as infrastructure and on-call work. However, we do plan to incentivize and encourage companies to hire people to work on Rust (not just in Rust).

One of the primary goals for the Foundation is to help folks get paid for their work on Rust. We think that‚Äôs critical for the long-term sustainability of the project and a core part of our mission. However, we don‚Äôt think the right way to do it is to have the Foundation hire a bunch of people directly.

Why not hire folks? For one thing, we don‚Äôt think a Foundation would be able to pay them what they‚Äôre worth or support them in the way they should be supported. We would have to hire human resourcing people, managers, figure out peoples‚Äô design goals and career path, and do all the other things that a good employer does, and that is not practical.

So, if we‚Äôre not hiring people, what are we doing instead? Our plan is to provide incentives that encourage companies to hire Rust developers. One way we are doing this is by providing discounts on the membership fees for every existing team member employed by a sponsor to work full time on the project. We also plan to create a place for team members to note they‚Äôre available to be hired to work on the project. (If you have other ideas for how we can incentivize companies to give people paid time to work on Rust, we‚Äôd love to hear them!)

Part of the strength of open source is that it is a great way to enable people from many companies, with many needs, to actively collaborate. If you have everyone working in one company (even a Foundation), you will do a good job solving that company‚Äôs problems, but you may totally overlook other kinds of problems. Bringing in that pluralist set of viewpoints is precisely what Rust is all about.

<a id="q-trademark"></a>
**ü§î Q: Who will have control over the Rust trademark?**

üíÅ A: Mozilla is the current owner of the Rust trademarks and they have committed to transferring it to the Foundation at its incorporation.

## Location of incorporation

<a id="q-location"></a>
**ü§î Q: Where are we incorporating?**

üíÅ A: The Rust Foundation will be incorporated as a US 501(c)(6) organization in the state of Delaware. We explored a number of alternatives, including Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, and the EU, but ultimately decided that the US would be our best choice.

The Rust project has contributors and users from all over the world, and one of the pillars of our work has been to ensure Rust keeps being a global project. We consulted leaders of other foundations and our own lawyers, and the conclusion we reached is that no matter where the foundation is located in the world there will always be a subset of people who might have trouble interacting with the Foundation.

There is no location that we can incorporate in that would effortlessly make us global by default. We will constantly make sure it represents and includes people from all over the world, not just the US: ensuring a foundation is global is not something we can do at the start and then forget about it, it‚Äôs a continuous effort.

<a id="q-usa"></a>
**ü§î Q: Why are we incorporating in the US?**

üíÅ A: We had some questions over the years that asked whether a potential Rust foundation will be outside of the US. For that reason, we spent time researching alternative locations. We came to the conclusion that the US was the best choice given our constraints. While there are good reasons to pick other locations, the potential benefit of those locations did not outweigh the costs.

Our goal for the foundation is to make the incorporation location matter as little as possible for accessing its services and being represented by it. Participation in the project is currently accessible -- and the IP policy for the project is set by a US corporation today too. There are no concrete blockers to contributions to the project due to the Foundation‚Äôs location.

Based on our research, in most cases the problems caused by an organization being in a specific country are operational; there are no insurmountable barriers put forth by legal restrictions. We are committed to investing the time into building operational practices that ensure global participation is not only possible but prioritized.

<a id="q-usa-contributors"></a>
**ü§î Q: Will the foundation being based in the US prevent contributing to Rust?**

üíÅ A: There are no current or anticipated impedances to contribution to the Rust project for any set of entities. Rust‚Äôs original steward, Mozilla, was also incorporated in the U.S., so the transfer of intellectual property and trademark to a 501(c)(6) in the U.S. doesn‚Äôt materially change anything. The lack of impedance to global contribution is derived from the completely open and public development and design of the Rust project, but to get more in depth on this would veer dangerously close to legal analysis, which I want to avoid because I am not a lawyer. While not definitive, and not necessarily representative of the Foundation‚Äôs perspective, [this post by GitHub](https://github.blog/2019-09-12-global-software-collaboration-in-the-face-of-sanctions/) is a good introduction to the topic for folks that are interested.

<a id="q-multiple"></a>
**ü§î Q: Will there only be one Rust foundation long term?**

üíÅ A: There is certainly nothing preventing a future where there are a plurality of Rust Foundations, though, at least for the moment I, personally, see more cost than benefit. It is worth considering the challenges it could bring to fundraising were there to be more than one place to donate; I think it'd be unfortunate to have multiple Foundations competing with each other for funding. Additionally, every new individual foundation would have operational overhead, which would divert money from Foundation causes. Then there is the potential overhead of having to coordinate efforts across multiple Foundations, or, if we were to fail to coordinate, the overhead of managing the lack of consensus. In my head it‚Äôs a classic distributed systems vs monolith tradeoff. I don‚Äôt know what the future will hold, but I can say that the Core Team definitely discussed this possibility, and we agreed that if it were to be something folks decided was the right call, it would need to be done thoughtfully, and likely be several years in the future.

## Governance structure of the foundation

<a id="q-bylaws"></a>
**ü§î Q: How will the foundation structure its board, bylaws and operations?**

üíÅ A: We‚Äôre still finalizing all the details around the foundation, and we plan to have the legal documents approved by the end of the year. Once that happens we‚Äôll announce everything around how the foundation works.

Still, there are a few things we can say now:

* The board will have representatives from both sponsor companies and project directors.
* The project directors will be drawn from active Rust team members.
* In true Rust spirit, we are structuring things so as to encourage active collaboration between the sponsor representatives and the project directors, and to ensure that the project directors are on board with whatever actions the Foundation takes.

Something else that‚Äôs very important to us: we want the workings of the Foundation to be accessible to everyone. To that end, we are planning to release not only the ‚Äúlegal bylaws‚Äù but also ‚Äúhuman readable‚Äù versions (translated into multiple languages), as well as ‚Äúguidebook‚Äù-like materials to help folks understand what it means to be a part of the foundation.

<a id="q-individual-donations"></a>
**ü§î Q: As an individual, can I donate money to the Rust Foundation?**

üíÅ A: Not yet but perhaps in the future. To start, we explicitly prioritized getting donations from companies over individuals. We believe that individuals -- especially those currently contributing to the Rust project -- already give so much to the project. While we have a number of corporate sponsors for Rust's infrastructure already, we have not been able to sponsor the Rust project‚Äôs broader needs in a directed manner quite yet. We want companies to take responsibility for giving back to the Rust community and project for the value that volunteers bring; their sponsoring the Rust Foundation is one key way for them to do so. The question on [hiring contributors](#q-hiring) also talks about some of the other ways we‚Äôre encouraging investment in the Rust project from our corporate sponsors.

<a id="q-individuals"></a>
**ü§î Q: Will Rust maintainers have a voice in the foundation?**

üíÅ A: Yes, absolutely Rust maintainers have a voice. The Foundation board will have a number of seats that are occupied by Rust team members and who are tasked with representing the project. Moreover, the current draft of the by-laws ensures that all decisions will require support from those directors and the directors appointed by the sponsors.

One note: in a legal sense, the draft by-laws of the Foundation provide for both ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù and ‚Äúindividual‚Äù membership. As a temporary measure, this ‚Äúindividual membership‚Äù is defined as being equal to the core team. It is the core team‚Äôs intent to expand that set to cover the Rust teams more generally.  Figuring out the right shape for such a process will require both time and broader consultation with the community as well as approval from the Foundation‚Äôs board, however, so we decided to defer that until after the Foundation is up and going.
